# Notice

This github is a temporary site used by members and staff of the Bluetooth SIG to investigate how we can publish assigned numbers and other public information.

The information on this website is a duplicate of assigned numbers pages, and associated pages, on the bluetooth.com website. If you are looking for an assigned number please use those webpages as the authoritative source.
